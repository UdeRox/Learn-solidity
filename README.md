# Learn-solidity
This repository has been created for the purpose of my personal learning journey, where I'll be exploring a range of concepts in Solidity, starting from the basics and moving towards more advanced topics. Throughout this project, I'll be utilizing Forge as the build tool to streamline development and experimentation. Feel free to browse through the code and documentation as I dive into the world of Ethereum smart contract development using Solidity. Your feedback and contributions are always welcome!

I have covered most of the concepts in Medium articles.
